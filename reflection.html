        <p>The basic “template” of this ePortfolio was coded from the ground up in Dr. Anastasia Salter’s “Digital Humanities in the Age of AI” course in Fall of 2024 by Vee Kennedy, with some assistance from GPT4o in terms of CSS. Particularly, the “owl carousel” feature was composed by GPT 4o; much of the rest of the code was done by hand by Vee based on past coding learning experiences and some reference materials from W3Schools. Prior to ENC 6952: Capstone in Writing and Rhetoric, the website contained only the front page and a basic CV, which had not been updated in about a year. Over the course of ENC 6952, I have added the Teaching Portfolio, Contact, and Reflection pages and all of their content. I have also updated the homepage and “Recent Publications and Highlighted Projects” carousel to feature more recent work and publications, and have included a Japanese translation of the blurb on the frontpage. This last change in particular I have opted to include because one of my recent peer-reviewed publications is in a Japanese journal and although it is written in English, given that I am bilingual, I hope to make it clear to colleagues both near and far that I am open to (and very excited about) collaboration across language and culture. Given that this is my very real, very live digital portfolio that I use and have used in the past for assorted applications, I intend to keep modifying it for further professional growth contexts. For further disclosure of GenerativeAI use, I did use GPT4o to double-check and correct some of my grammar and vocabulary choices in Japanese. I did not use any AI tools in the process of writing any English text.</p>   

       <p>In terms of the overall rhetorical situation of this ePortfolio, I sit at a complicated moment in my academic career. I am about to go into candidacy exams for my PhD and have been drafting my prospectus, which means that in the near future, I will be eligible to apply for tenure-track faculty positions. At the same time, I am also in the middle of my fourth full-time year at the University of Central Florida as a faculty member, which means that next year I will be eligible to apply for a Teaching Incentive Program (TIP) Award, and the following year, I’ll be eligible to apply for promotion from Instructor to Associate Instructor. All of these opportunities require me to prepare a portfolio of both my teaching and research contributions to the field, with each opportunity valuing either a bit differently. Given that my hope is to stay at the University of Central Florida and make myself as competitive as possible for both tenure-line positions and promotion opportunities in my current job, it’s important for me to highlight my contributions in all three categories: teaching, research, and service to the university. It’s also important for me to continue to develop my materials outside of this ePortfolio (such as cover letters and statements) when applying for each of these opportunities.</p>  

       <p>This semester I had the wonderful privilege of working with several peer and student editors who suggested some wonderful usability and accessibility updates for my ePortfolio, including font and font color changes to reduce eye strain and making links open in new tabs in order to increase ease of navigation. I appreciated these recommendations greatly, as many of them were tasks that I had hoped to do but never quite made the time for prior to someone else pointing it out to me. </p>

       <p>When I first constructed this ePortfolio’s basic template a year ago, I had no academic publications to my name and was quite afraid that frankly I never would. I close out this year with three peer-reviewed publications to my name, one additional editorially reviewed publication, and more pieces pending and with several others on submission. In an earlier assignment in this class I was asked to plan out some upcoming career plans, including both short-term and long-term goals. A number of these goals included publications and conferences. While those goals certainly do still exist, my most important and concrete short term goal includes completing all of my exam reading and course revisions prior to 11:59 P.M. on December 12th so that I can enjoy a nice, firm holiday break without interruption between December 13th and January 5th, and prioritizing rest and rejuvenation during the holiday season, before returning strong in January to conquer exams. One very important value I have internalized this semester is the importance of working smarter, not harder, and working efficiently in order to ensure things are done right the first time, but also, the importance of stopping. I learned about the concept of “autistic inertia,” and how for me, much like how some neurodivergent people experience difficulties with executive dysfunction that prevents them from starting tasks, the difficulty for me instead lies in stopping them, and transitioning into periods of rest. Now that I understand this about myself, I need to be very intentional about the act of stopping and taking time for me. This is easier said than done, but is the most essential thing I have learned that will help me flourish as both an academic and a human person.</p>
