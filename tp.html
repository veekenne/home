        <h2>Teaching Philosophy Statement</h2>
    </div>
    <!-- Content Section -->
    <div class="content">
<p>I believe that writing is a process, and that people can learn to write by practicing writing - on their own, with peers, and with the ethical use of digital tools, which is why I embrace large language models like ChatGPT and GoogleBard as a writing technology when used with intentionality. In Rhetoric & Writing Studies, we practice these skills when we ask students to purposefully integrate multimodality and multiliteracies into their work and develop information literacy skills. Writing curricula function best when they are influenced by the canons of both modern and ancient rhetoricians, which ultimately all teach in some capacity the importance of writing as a tool for thinking. Contemporary teaching of multimodality and information literacy must now include artificial intelligence, including how and when to use these technologies appropriately, how to provide appropriate attribution to the technology, the limitations of the technology, and assessing the legitimacy and correctness of the technology’s output. Not only does this empower students in a growingly digital world, but it also normalizes the use of adaptive technology for those of us who are disabled and as such may need to use technological devices in class for accessibility reasons.</p>
<p>Allow me to provide an example of how these beliefs function within my classroom space. Imagine walking (or zooming) into a college composition classroom on your first day at your new university. Perhaps you are a brand-new First Time in Any College student, or perhaps you are a transfer student. You may have benefitted from ample preparation for college writing in your prior educational experiences, or you may have not. The one thing you know for certain is that you absolutely must pass this class to graduate, whether you plan on majoring in Writing and Rhetoric, or if you plan to never take a writing class again. </p>
<p>The instructor plays some AI-generated music and asks who is singing, only to then inform the class that the artist they think is singing never sang this piece, and that the music they’re hearing was constructed by a computer without the artist’s permission and that they were never compensated for the use of their voice. You and your classmates are temporarily riled up enough to want to throw your laptops out the window and swear off technology forever, but then the instructor explains that this same technology was used to let us have one last goodbye with our favorite Star Wars princess and general, Carrie Fisher, and a part of how Dr. Stephen Hawking was able to conduct scholarly work and communicate for an additional fifty years we would not have had otherwise, and even part of how we can have automatically generated captions in our lecture. On the syllabus, the first place we turn is the accommodations section page. The instructor holds up copies of their own Letters of Accommodation from college and invites students to speak to them privately if they’ve ever had a letter like this or a 504 plan or IEP in K-12, think they might need one of these letters, or if they have any questions about disability in college, including mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. The instructor also explicitly states that the letter is in no way a prerequisite to this conversation. All are welcome, at all times.</p>
<p>Later, the instructor opens a new tab in ChatGPT and pastes the first assignment prompt into the chat bar. Together, all parties in the room discuss what the technology outputs in conjunction with the rubric. While the product of the technology may be a good start to stimulate one’s writing process, we discuss how the technology cannot authentically replicate the experience of participating in a college writing class and re-thinking, re-seeing, and rewriting a piece and how if all we are able to produce as writers is the same as what this technology can, we are unemployable. Nuance and proper use, we realize, are everything, and we must strive to develop and nurture skill sets that will set us apart after graduation.</p>    
<p>Together we will spend a semester writing, communicating, and learning in ways that will prepare us all for a diverse set of experiences going forward, regardless of what our backgrounds are, whether we plan to continue college coursework either in this university or in another one, or what majors or career plans we might embark on.
